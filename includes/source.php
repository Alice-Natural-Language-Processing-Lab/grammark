<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>I advocate <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">open-source</a> philosophy: things (tools, art, knowledge) should be available for other people to adapt and improve. This includes educational web-tools like grammar checkers. So this website is both free to use and to modify, so long as you allow others to do the same with whatever you create.
